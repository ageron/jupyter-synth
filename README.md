<hr />

In this notebook we will have fun with sound in Python: we will synthesize sounds (sine, square, triangle, noise), play chords and melodies, apply sound effects (e.g., fade-in/out, echo, vibrato, low/high-pass filter, stereo panning), and read/write audio files in Python.

**Note:** The goal is to learn the fundamentals of sound processing by implementing everything from scratch, but in a real project you will want to use specialized libraries such as [librosa](https://librosa.org/).
